# hexai

Instructions:

Run `toy/toy_script_0` to train the AI to play the toy test game.
The model is saved in `toy/hmodel0` and you can test it by running
`toy/deploy_0`.

Run `hex/hex_script_1` to train the AI to play the modified ruleless version
of Hex. The model is saved in `hex/hmodel1` and you can test it by running
`hex/deploy_1`.

In both cases, pre-trained models are already available, and you can run the 
deploy scripts directly.
